	<h1>About <span class="orange">UN</span>PLEXING</h1>

	<h2>The Story</h2>
	<p>
		<span class="orange">UN</span>PLEXING is the culmination of many thought provoking conversations,
		complaint sessions, and more between Jesse Roach and Adam Presley.
		Both have worked together in many projects and often find that complex
		processes, over-architected solutions, and difficult tools, over time,
		lessen the joy that is software development, and delivering a good,
		solid software product.
