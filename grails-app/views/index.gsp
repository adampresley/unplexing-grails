	<h1><span class="orange">UN</span>PLEXING</h1>


	<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
	<p>
		<span class="orange">UN</span>PLEXING is the art of simply software engineering.  The entire premise is less complexity, 
		and more getting the job done in a simple and elegant manner.  As a practitioner of 
		<span class="orange">UN</span>PLEXING we promise to engineer software in a manner that is simple, maintainable, and gets 
		the job done without overly-complex processes, framework, or anything else that hinders the 
		progress of actual software development.
	</p>


	<h2>The Premise</h2>
	<p>
		The idea of <span class="orange">UN</span>PLEXING is simple.  Software engineers should focus more on 
		writing software and software components, and less on complex processes and over-engineering.  
		Less time should be spent on designing some difficult system trying to account for what might 
		happen in the future. Focus should be on the crafting of quality code.
	</p>

	<p>
		These principles do not mean we, as software engineers, should ignore good design and best 
		practices. Indeed these should be considered and followed, but never at the expense of achieving 
		the goal, which is a good piece of software, component, or API for a customer or fellow developer. 
	</p>

	<p class="strong">
		<span class="orange">UN</span>PLEXING is the ongoing goal to remove complex and hindering processes and architectures from 
		a software project.  
	</p>


	<h2>Section 1: Regarding Engineering</h2>
	<p>
		The following should be considered guidelines to follow while engineering a software project.
	</p>
	<br />

	<ol>
		<li>Software projects always have a customer.  This can someone paying for your final 
			application, a developer using a library you are writing, or even a random individual 
			downloading your open source project.  The customer is the most important aspect of the 
			project.</li>
		<li>Temper all decisions with the question "What is best for the project and the customer?"  
			When deciding on a framework, component, infrastructure, or any other mundane detail that 
			a customer is less likely to care about, remember the final goal is a great software product.</li>
		<li>Do not try to predict the future.  The very nature of software is that it is "soft", and 
			can change. </li>
		<li>Do try to write easily changed software.  Since software DOES change, design your application 
			so it can be changed.  Expect it.  But do not spend too much time, effort, or money on trying 
			to make a system super flexible.  In the end you will have a big mess of hard to understand code.</li>
		<li>Remove unnecessary processes.  Processes exist to provide accountability, historical tracking, 
			and a means to achieve the end goal: a software product.  When the process suddenly becomes a 
			hindrance, it is time to look at removing or evolving it.</li>
		<li>Do not over-engineer/architect.  It is all too easy to start over-compensating for previously 
			bad designs and coding habits by building more layers.  Layers of concern... layers for facade... 
			local service layers... remote service layers...  Spend more time achieving the goal and less 
			time architecting.  The architecture should support the software product, not the other way around.</li>
	</ol>


	<h2>Section 2: Regarding Meetings and Communications</h2>
	<p>
		The following should be considered guidelines to follow regarding meetings and communications during the 
		course of a project.
	</p>
	<br />

	<ol>
		<li>Have a point.  If you are sending an email or hosting a meeting, make sure there is a point, and 
			get to it quickly.  There is little reason to waste time, or break precious concentration on 
			meetings, emails, or IMs that have no direct effect on the project.</li>
		<li>Decide quickly and concisely.  Should a meeting, email, or IM be necessary, get to the point and 
			make decisions quickly.  Nothing burns time and productivity more than weeks worth of meetings 
			belaboring a single point. Gather the top minds and decision makers together with a defined goal of 
			deciding something, make a decision, and get back to work.</li>
		<li>Stop using "we".  Ownership.  If you are personally involved in making a decision gone wrong, own it.  
			Apologize, then fix it.  If a co-worker or subordinate has made the mistake, point it out.  This 
			does not always have to be in a public setting, and can be private.  The same goes for successes.  
			If there is a success it is fine to congratulate the team, but don't be shy in praising an individual 
			for specific achievements.</li>
		<li>Learn when it stops working.  If a meeting has started becoming repetitive and seemingly unproductive, 
			it probably is unproductive.  Shake it up.  Either change the meeting format and content, or cancel 
			it altogether.</li>
	</ol>
